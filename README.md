# Dev Environment

Minimal nu script to setup and update development environment in [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/).

## How to use?

1. Install [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/).
2. In Nushell, run `nu setup.nu`.

## Steps

### Step `#1`: Check package installations.

This script requires [`rustup`](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and `cargo` to be installed.

### Step `#2`: Install essential ðŸ¦€ Rust tools.

These are the rust tools that will be installed during the setup:

```nu
â•­â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â•®
â”‚ 0 â”‚ eza       â”‚
â”‚ 1 â”‚ fd-find   â”‚
â”‚ 2 â”‚ mprocs    â”‚
â”‚ 3 â”‚ git-graph â”‚
â”‚ 4 â”‚ git-delta â”‚
â”‚ 5 â”‚ bacon     â”‚
â•°â”€â”€â”€â”´â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â•¯
```

### Step `#3`: Setup helix.

[Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) will be installed/updated.

### Step `#4`: Setup configurations.

Currently, Windows is the only system host that is being supported for this step.

Included configurations:
1. Terminal
2. Helix
3. Git

### Step `#5`: Setup development directories.

A `develop` directory will be created outside of this directory with these subfolders:

```nu
..\develop
â”œâ”€â”€ notes
â”œâ”€â”€ other
â”œâ”€â”€ projects
â””â”€â”€ temp
```
